revise all the language of which i lose context
this is important Since When we switch between languages , say for example from php to .net then the syntaxes would change, but the basic work flow in any language is almost d same, 
you have the algo
you have the data structures
that 2 things remains the same
which is the most important thing in any programming languages


You might use if u want and can create branches and can also contribute if u found anything which needs to change
THank you in advance...

basically it is based on component modelling in short for front hand.
looks something like this:-
class Square extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>
	Its a Square
	</h1>
    );
  }
}
there are two main methods of a React.Component :-
render() which returns a react type object. the syntax we saw above is strange. It is neither string or HTML. Its called JSX.
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
where element is our react element and here root is the id of element inside which we wwant to append our component.

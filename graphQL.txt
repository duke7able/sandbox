GraphQL basics
Basically we need a schema according to that it makes and remembers structure
It is used in places where we have large data and normal RESTFull API's can create a lot of calls to the server, for even simple task.
This reduces the number of calls and optimally fetches or in general does CRUD or anything on that.
Then we have a GraphQLObjectType which is the schema object , we need to get that from graphql , which we need to install.
Like :-
Const { GraphQLObjectType } = require('graphql')

There are 2 main things about writing test cases, i.e. unit test cases
One is Testing environment , one of the most popular on is mocha in javascript
another thing is Assertion Library , famous among it is chai which gets set very good with mocha

a very simple example below: -
run this from command mocha

const assert = require('chai').assert

describe('user test cases', () => {
  it('signing API', () => {
    assert.equal('hello', 'hello')
  })
})
